def read_a2m_gz_folder(folder):
    """
    This will read and return the MSAs from all a2m.gz files in the folder given.
    The MSAs will be returned as a list of numpy arrays, where each list element/numpy array corresponds to a a2m.gz file.
    Each MSA will have the shape (n x l) where n is the number of sequence alignments found, and l is the sequence length.
    The MSA will be returned as numbers ranging from 0-20, which cover the 20 common amino acids as well as '-' which contains everything else.

    The a2m.gz format is expected to be similar to the following example:

    >XXXX_UPI0000E497C4/159-301 [subseq from] XXXX_UPI0000E497C4

    Where each line starting with ">" signals a header line, meaning that a new sequence is comming on the following lines.
    Note that the last sequence in the sequence should be the origin sequence.
    So in the above example we have 2 sequences and the origin sequence.
    Note this has only been tested on windows.
